#Wild West Forum

**COS498- Fall 2025 Midterm Project**

##Overview
This is an intentionally insecure web forum built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Handlebars**, and **Nginx**, 
containerized using **Docker** and managed with **docker-compose**.

It allows users to register, log in/log out, and post comments, all stored in simple **in-memory arrays**.
This project includes a **Public Git Repository** with meaningful commit history.

docker compose up

This will build both the Node.js and Nginx containers
